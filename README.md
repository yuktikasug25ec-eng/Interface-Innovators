# Robotics Club Website

## Developer Information
- **Team members:** [Yuktika Singh] [Suhani Sinha] [Niharika Prakash] [Matam Nikhitha Sree] 
- **Contact:** [yuktikas.ug25.ec@nitp.ac.in] | [9532353500] | [(https://github.com/yuktikasug25ec-eng/Interface-Innovators)]

## Technology Choice and Reason
This website is built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. The choice of technologies was made because:
- **Simplicity and Accessibility:** HTML, CSS, and JS are fundamental web technologies that require no server-side setup, making the site easy to deploy and maintain.
- **Performance:** Static site with no backend reduces load times and hosting costs.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Works across all modern browsers without additional frameworks.
- **Ease of Development:** Allows for quick prototyping and direct manipulation of DOM elements.

## Ensuring Future Scalability
To ensure the website remains scalable:
- **Modular CSS Structure:** Styles are split into separate files (`main.css`, `components.css`, `responsive.css`) for better organization and maintainability.
- **Responsive Design:** Uses media queries and flexible layouts to adapt to different screen sizes.
- **JavaScript Modules:** JS is divided into modules (`main.js`, `filters.js`, `modals.js`) for separation of concerns.
- **Component-Based HTML:** Reusable HTML structures (e.g., cards, navigation) allow for easy expansion.
- **Version Control:** Git is used for tracking changes and collaboration.
