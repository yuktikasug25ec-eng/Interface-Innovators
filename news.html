    <h3>Doosan Robotics Wins Two CES Innovation Awards 2026 for AI-Driven Industrial Robot</h3>
    <p class="meta">📅 November 6, 2025 | 🏷 CES Innovation Awards / Doosan Robotics press release – PR Newswire via RoboticsTomorrow</p>

    <p>
      In November 2025, Doosan Robotics, a South Korea–based leader in collaborative and industrial automation, received two distinguished honors at the CES Innovation Awards 2026 ahead of the major annual technology expo in Las Vegas. The company’s Scan & Go Autonomous Robotic Solution was recognized as a Best of Innovation winner in the Artificial Intelligence category and also recognized in the Robotics category for its groundbreaking design and engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Scan & Go system is an AI-powered autonomous robotic solution developed in collaboration with Maple Advanced Robotics Inc. It’s engineered specifically to improve safety and productivity in demanding industrial environments—such as composite maintenance operations—where traditional manual labor poses risks from noise, fine dust, repetitive strain, and hazardous conditions. With advanced safety protocols, torque-sensing collision detection, and fence-free operation, Scan & Go enables more efficient and secure execution of complex tasks, particularly in sectors like wind energy manufacturing where safety and precision are critical.

    <h3>INSAIT Advances Robotic Visual Generalization at ICRA 2025</h3>
    <p class="meta">📅 May 23, 2025 | 🏷 INSAIT press release & research announcement</p>

    <p>
      At ICRA 2025, one of the most prestigious global conferences in robotics and automation, a research team from the Bulgarian institute INSAIT achieved a major scientific milestone in the field of robot vision and generalization. Their study focused on a core challenge in robotics: enabling machines to apply learned visual skills reliably in environments and situations that differ from their training data—so-called “out-of-domain” (OOD) scenarios.
    </p>

    <p>
      The researchers evaluated the robustness of leading robotic visual foundation models and found that existing approaches often struggle when faced with unfamiliar contexts due to issues like catastrophic forgetting and insufficient training diversity. To tackle this, they developed a new approach called ReVLA. This method improves visual reasoning by applying gradual backbone reversal through model merging, which significantly enhances a robot’s ability to generalize its visual understanding while keeping strong performance in known environments.
